# 🚀 Space Safety Object Detection
Detect safety-related objects (OxygenTank,NitrogenTank ,FirstAidBox ,FireAlarm ,SafetySwitchPanel ,EmergencyPhone ,FireExtinguisher) using YOLOv8 and Streamlit.

## 🔗 Live Demo
[Click here to try the app](https://space-safety-object-detection-ksbwdfdkrr78cpywp6yztb.streamlit.app/)

## Overview
This project demonstrates **real-time safety object detection** using **YOLOv8** integrated with a **Streamlit app**.  
It was developed for hackathons and academic demos, focusing on detecting safety-related objects (like helmets, vests, or restricted items) with a polished user interface and reproducible workflow.

## Features
- 🔍 Object detection powered by YOLOv8  
- 🎛️ Adjustable confidence threshold slider  
- 🖼️ Image upload and prediction visualization  
- 📊 Evaluation metrics reporting  
- 🌐 Streamlit app for interactive demo  
- 📂 Organized dataset preprocessing and training scripts
